# FaceTrace

FaceTrace is a real-time face tracking program implemented in Python using the OpenCV library. The program captures video from a webcam and employs a pre-trained face cascade classifier to detect faces in each frame. Detected faces are outlined with purple rectangles, and their centers are marked with black circular dots. The program continuously prints the coordinates of the center and the area of the largest detected face.
